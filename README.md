  In October 2007, San Francisco roommates Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia were struggling to pay rent. During a local design conference that had filled all hotels, they saw an opportunity. They rented out air mattresses in their living room, creating a simple website called "AirBed & Breakfast."

  Their first three guests each paid $80 per night, proving the concept's potential. In early 2008, they invited former roommate Nathan Blecharczyk to join as the third co-founder and CTO.

  The site officially launched in August 2008, eventually shortened to "Airbnb," the concept expanded beyond air mattresses to include entire homes and unique properties worldwide.

  During the 2008 presidential campaign, they came up with an audacious idea: selling politically themed breakfast cereals. They designed and produced limited-edition boxes of "Obama O's" and "Cap'n McCain's" cereal. This quirky venture proved to be a lifeline, netting them about $30,000 â€“ crucial funds that kept Airbnb afloat during its most challenging period.
  
 In 2009, they received their first major funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator, and the company began to grow rapidly.

  Airbnb's story shows how a simple solution to a personal problem can grow into a global business, disrupting an entire industry. From air mattresses in a living room, it evolved into a platform connecting millions of hosts and travellers across the globe.

  Today, Airbnb boasts more than 5 million hosts worldwide with over 7 million listings as of today, offering unique stays in over 220 countries and regions. The platform's explosive growth is reflected in the numbers: from 2009 to 2024, Airbnb facilitated over half a billion guest arrivals. In 2019 alone, on any given night, an average of 2 million people were staying in an Airbnb.

  But Airbnb's impact goes beyond just numbers. It has transformed travel experiences, local economies, and the very concept of hospitality. As we delve deeper into the data behind Airbnb's success, we'll uncover the stories of hosts and travellers, explore market trends, and examine how this innovative platform continues to shape the future of travel.
